ML, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, relates the problem of learning from data samples to the
general concept of inference. Every learning process consists of two phases:
(i) Estimation of unknown dependenciesin a system from a given dataset. 

(ii) Use of estimated dependencies to predict new outputs of the system. ML has also
been proven an interesting area in biomedical research with many applications, where
an acceptable generalization is obtained by searching through an n-dimensional space
for a given set of biological samples, using different techniques and algorithms. There
are two main common types of ML methods known as 
               (i) supervised learning and (ii) unsupervised learning. 
               
(iii) In supervised learning a labeled set of training data is used to estimate or map the
input data to the desired output. In contrast, under the unsupervised learningmethods
no labeled examples are provided and there is no notion of the output during the
learning process.

(iv) Two other common ML tasks are regression and clustering. In the case of regression
problems, a learning function maps the data into a real-value variable.Subsequently, for each new sample the value of a predictive variable can be estimated, based on this
process. Clustering is a common unsupervised task in which one tries to find the
categories or clusters in order to describe the data items. Based on this process each
new sample can be assigned to one of the identified clusters concerning the similar
characteristicsthat they share
